# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data.

The following techniques have been used:

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script

## Use the env.yml file to create a conda environment
`conda env create -f env.yml -n new_env`

## Activate the environment
`conda activate new_env`

## Install the package by installing build distribution
` pip install dist/HousePricePrediction-0.4.1-py3-none-any.whl ` or `pip install HousePricePrediction-0.4.1-py3-none-any.whl`

## To check the successful installation of the package , run the below command
` pytest tests/functional_tests/test_installation.py `


## To create a MLFlow server, run the below command
`mlflow server --backend-store-uri mlruns/  --default-artifact-root mlruns/ --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000 `

## To run the python script , run the below command
`python src/HousePricePrediction/mlflow_run.py`
